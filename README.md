## Key Features

1. **Book Details:** Each book has a detailed page that includes information such as title, author, publication year, and the number of copies.

2. **Book Borrowing:** Users can borrow books by specifying the borrowing and return dates.

3. **Rating and Comments:** Users can rate and comment on books they have read.
